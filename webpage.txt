		"In 1997, a group of physicians and researchers defined the minimally conscious state (MCS) as a condition of severely altered consciousness in which a person demonstrates minimal but definite behavioral evidence of self or environmental awareness. Patients in the MCS state appear very similar to those in the unconscious "vegetative" state with one key distinction: patients in MCS will have intermittent periods of normal arousal, if only brief and barely detectable. This video sound art installation will speculate on the sensory and cognitive experience of a brain-injured patient in the minimally conscious state. It explores themes such as consciousness, relationships between perception and reality, and the importance of human relationships and effects of their loss. The project has a minimalist style in both visual and sound elements, relying on abstract forms, reduction in detail and color and an emphasis on the processing of content rather than on narrative and meaning." -- abstract.

That moment changes the course of her growing up. The narrative reveals how it happens--her gradual entrapment--as it weaves together the strands of her life before and after the rape, making clear how her will to be 'good' becomes entangled with her dawning conviction that she is irredeemably bad. From the outside, she looks like a normal teenage girl (learning to drive, going to prom), but the brash, manipulative Mr. Filinuk calls her a seductress who compels him to leave his wife and drives him to violence." -- abstract.

Comprised of longer stories and short shorts, traditional narratives and experimental forms, the collections resists a unified tone of voice, shifting between grave solemnity and outrageous humor. Loneliness runs as an undercurrent through most of the stories, but the collection as a whole does not settle for a pessimistic vision. Most of the characters, after struggling to connect with others--whether potential lovers or their own families--have to find their own paths to happiness, and though some may wallow in despair, others reach surprising moments of redemption." -- abstract.

		"The following selected essays are an account of the semester I spent studying abroad in India. Part memoir, part travel narrative, these essays range in content from the story of a trek up the side of a mountain and what was at the top, the recollection of my weakest moment, a handful of stories about the characters that comprised my Hindu "family," to finally a pronouncement on the precarious situation that third world countries struggling to become first world face. In the process, it is this author's goal to paint as clear a picture as picture [sic] as possible of a country, its people and culture.  Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, always brutally honest, these stories comprise but a small part of that experience and intend to examine not only a post-colonial country in the infant stage of democracy, but the travelers--specifically this traveler--that frequent its shores and partake of its culture." -- abstract.

He begins to hear a plastic toy speaking to him, and based on the toy's advice he undergoes a self-makeover in order to improve his chances with this woman. The themes of traditional film musicals are explored and challenged, with the gender roles reversed in many cases. The worlds of fantasy and whimsy (musical numbers and talking toys) are set against the backdrop of a beach resort driven by a transient tourist economy. "Phil the dophin" attempts to entertain and at the same time create doubts about the perception of reality. Its central theme of taking a risk to make your dream come true is meant to inspire viewers and to leave the audience questioning what is truly important to them." -- abstract.

		"This experimental short seeks to recreate the filmmaker's dream about motherhood. On the one hand, the piece is deeply personal, deriving its story and imagery from the individual's subconscious. On the other hand, the topic is accessible, particularly to women, among whom dreams of pregnancy, childbearing and motherhood are not unusual. The primary goals of the project are to visualize the individual's unconscious landscape and to use filmic language and techniques, rather than performance, to generate emotion. This 'dream film' draws its inspiration from early Surrealist filmmakers like Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and Jean Cocteau, as well as avant-garde pioneer Maya Deren and Europeans masters Ingmar Bergmann and Federico Fellini. The value of such an endeavor is mainly personal; it is an opportunity for the filmmaker to examine a dream experience visually and aurally, much like a dream therapist would use written or oral records for analysis." -- abstract.

		"'F.A.T. and Other Stories' is a collection of thematically linked short stories, centering on cultural issues of body weight, size, and image. In some pieces, the struggle with weight and food are readily apparent; 'Ripples' attempts to capture the moment in adolescence when worries about size and image crystallize into personal anxiety, and 'Not by Bread Alone' presents the ironic devastation of a gourmand after he suffers a freak accident that destroys his sense of smell and therefore taste. 'F.A.T.,' the title story, traces the current mode of fitness obsession to extreme and frightening conclusions. Pieces like 'Hot Sex' and 'The Fattest Ballerina' are grounded in the everyday, examining characters who struggle with weight outside of extraordinary circumstances. Within the collection, 'A Teaching Moment,' 'When the Dream is Waking,' and 'Hannon Exercise #1,' are a trio of linked stories featuring Bess McGill, a young woman haunted by the untimely death of her father and her psychological struggle with food and grief. All of the stories in this collection seek to represent men and women who face their own demons of size and image, whose weight at times precludes them from fitting into what has increasingly become the primary standard of social acceptance." -- abstract.

My earlier poems tend to have a more serious, darker tone, while my more recent poems have a lighter, more humorous tone.

		"This paper is a reflection on the process of researching, writing, revising, and staging a one-woman play based on the life of the famous American artist of the Victorian Era, Mary Cassatt. The desire to dramatize the story of a woman artist springs from the need to present a positive role model for women. Too often art books contain a dearth of information on women artists because men largely write the history of art. This play, Tea with Mary Cassatt, was written in order to address this lack. Lessons learned from the creation of this play and its staging are offered as a road map to others who wish to fashion a one-person play based upon a historical figure. It is hoped that such artistic renderings can be used for the presentation of positive role models." -- abstract.

Now, she juggles the end of a close friendship, a mounting debt and imminent eviction, the emotional impact of a physical assault, the attention of a lovely Buddhist waiter, and a new job modeling stripper shoes for a fetish catalog.

Jamaica had encountered large-scale recruitment of many of its registered nurses to the United States and England only a few years prior. The story of the exodus of several hundred Jamaican teachers and the struggle that many of them faced in New York City was reported sporadically in the press but never examined in a broader-based study or article. In three short years, the program had died, despite a plan that was initially seen as promising by administrators in both places. This project tells the story behind the New York City international teacher recruitment program for Jamaica and examines why the program failed." -- abstract.

		"El Segundo got its name in 1912, when Standard Oil built its second refinery in California there. I grew up in El Segundo. Although surrounded by the sprawl of Los Angeles, it feels like a small town. Most residents are white, and the city advertises itself as 'Mayberry by the sea.' While living in Chicago as an adult, I worked on a research project at the university from which I had just received my diploma. The project followed public housing residents as they searched for private market apartments throughout the area. During this project, I investigated the lives of people I never would have met otherwise. In this thesis, I contemplate the divide I crossed while moving between El Segundo and Chicago, and explore the implications of living in either, or both, of these worlds." -- abstract.

Told in rotating points of view between two strong but dissimilar 'twin' sisters, this novel explores the tragedy of loss, the meaning of kinship, the cost of family secrets, and, ultimately, the sacrifices sometimes necessary to be true to oneself. A humorous but powerful novel, Girls, Girls, Out showcases the Lowcountry and its inhabitants, from unconventional island doctors and libertine brothers to 'leftover' family members and evangelistic grandmothers. The novel follows the twin sisters, as one struggles with physical adversity and the other deals with the startling complexities of personal salvation and self-discovery." -- abstract.

Palestinians and Israelis alike have always attempted to gain a positive public image by trying to refute each others' claims and in defending their respective historical narratives. However, a review of past history of coexistence between Arabs and Jews suggests that a just solution could potentially be achieved, if the two groups decided to reframe the conflict in a way that humanizes the similar needs that undergird the conflict and its tumultuous history. The first requirement is to enhance the image and ultimately, credibility and respect of Israelis in the Palestinian eyes, while simultaneously enhanching the Palestinian image, credibility and respect within the Israeli public. Both sides can then move forward in the effort to resolve the century-old conflict." -- abstract.

What was supposed to be a quick stop for coffee turns into a much longer ordeal for nature-hating Amy. During Amy's long day at camp, she discovers a secret about Dave and Sarah, and is fawned over by Nate and Travis.

The theatre experience asks very different things of its audiences than popular media does and stakeholders in children's arts education must adapt to meet young people's needs. Theatre companies, artists, and teachers must look beyond the common vehicles for introducing theatre to young, novice audiences and embrace new methods that will work better for them. This paper includes recommendations for maximizing the effectiveness of live theatrical experiences for students in grades K-4 after a thorough examination of their challenges as novice audience members." -- abstract.

Much of the work engages with form and meter, including fixed forms such as the sonnet and pantoum; stanza forms including Sapphics and ballad stanzas; and various metrical devices such as blank verse, Anglo-Saxon verse, and flirtations with the triple meters. The three sections, 'Walking Cane,' 'She Shook It,' and 'Piedmont,' record the struggle to locate oneself in relation to the land, within the female body, and in the particular, unique landscape of the Piedmont." -- abstract.

This hybrid collection--part memoir, part objective profiles, part reflection--attempts to make sense of the concept and meaning of work in our personal lives and in the American culture, including the inheritance of the ideal of the American Dream, the privileges and burdens of cultural expectations around success, the difficulty of figuring out what to be when you grow up, and the devastating effects of unemployment on American lives." -- abstract.

		"Rubber City is a collection of seven short stories inspired by the city of Akron, Ohio, the rubber capitol of the world. Akron's bedrock tire companies, B.F. Goodrich, Firestone, and Goodyear have presence, as well as music natives Devo and Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders; Summit Mall, symbol of suburban sprawl and growing indistinctness; and the descendent Downtown Akron, once the city's heartbeat. Rubber City introduces characters who, like the city itself, struggle with identity. Romance and sex obsessions, along with vast imaginations, become the daily coping mechanisms in the lives of these Akronites." -- abstract.

In order to capture the complexity of such a character, I have structured this novel in an episodic fashion; the manuscript itself is divided into six main sections. Each section is further broken down into three short chapters, all pulling from one of the following eras: Jeannie as a child, Jeannie as an adult, and Jeannie as seen through the eyes of an unnamed narrator. Though seemingly unrelated, all the pieces of this puzzle are designed to fit together, ultimately providing a psychological 'map' with which one might understand, and hopefully sympathize with, my main character." -- abstract.

Ultimately, 2 Inches Tall reaches beyond the miniature wargaming realm, exposing a larger cultural engagement with the pervasive, complex, and enigmatic nature of war itself." -- abstract.

I initially judged the classes based on their educational levels, classroom demographics, school environment, and socio-economic status/cultural background. Through lesson planning and reflection, I discovered what does not work when teaching Kindergarten drama classes. I also found how valuable effective classroom management techniques can be, not only in leading successful lessons, but in improving my own confidence and adaptability. In the end, those first judgements were much less meaningful, as I learned how to appreciate the individual students and be flexible enough to make my lessons work for all five classes I taught." -- abstract.

In any given department store, coffee shop, or highway rest stop, a woman might walk in on a conversation about a sultry romance, lazy husband, glamorous job, or simply unexplained tears. Although these people are strangers, their stories affect us in some way as we stand next to them, eliciting feelings of jealousy, pity, empathy, elation, horror, or just guilt for eavesdropping on someone's private moment. My essays cover a similar range of emotions. The line for the women's room is often long and boring, but my hope is that parts of the stories I tell would cause someone to run out to a friend and say, 'You won't believe what I just heard...". -- abstract.

		"This collection of short stories explores the connections and tensions between the rational and imaginative worlds, with special emphasis on the role of women. My characters are often experiencing the world through 'surface logic,' a self-contained system of understanding that simplifies experience, but in doing so reduces its complexity. The mythic and imaginative spheres seek to reintroduce the emotional and the messy into the lives of my characters. In 'Children at Play,' a make-believe game gone too far forces Sean to come to terms with the evil in himself, in 'Performance Artists,' Sadie's thesis challenges Ian to experience life without his mask of professionalism, and I hope that 'The Angel in the House' will push readers to question the unspoken gender rules that perpetuate and govern our behavior." -- abstract.

The intent of this project is to share my story with others who struggle with the same issues. There is a personal cathartic element as well. I am trying to demonstrate where, as Dr. Wayne Dyer says 'I must understand and then give up my personal history so that I no longer have a story to live up to anymore'. My own journey took me from self medicating with Prozac, fast food, cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs, to the martial art of Tai Chi, Dr. Wayne Dyer and a relationship with God that does not involve organized religion and, for me, the beginnings of peace of mind." -- abstract.

While they are learning how to handle issues and conflicts in their own lives, they will also have opportunities to mentor younger girls and raise money for the Athena program and for charities in their communities. As they cultivate their communication skills, build self-confidence, grow as mentors and youth advocates and gain skills to empower themselves, they will grow to be respected leaders in our society.

In building the audience-participatory scenes, I considered the context of living history methodology, choosing a first-person interpretation approach. The goal of the Folkways project is to help visitors experience the life of an early seventeenth-century Puritan settler. With that goal in mind, I attempted to apply Multiple Intelligence Theory to the script development, intending for the scenes to engage as many different audience members as possible. The following paper chronicles these efforts as well as the historical research required to give the scenes authenticity. Finally, the paper describes the process of writing and rehearsing the scenes for their inclusion in the Folkways living history project." -- abstract.

The text was analyzed to uncover how the use of various words can shape portrayals of women in print media. This study assumes the images portrayed in Glamour seek to parallel readers, as well as allow readers to relate and be inspired by the women in the magazine. Findings indicate Glamour uses frames, stereotypes, and myths within its articles to inspire readers and allow for identification with images in the magazine. Themes found in the articles have the same objectives of inspiration and recognition, and the news was reported with a positive tone. This study suggests new images of women emerged and old ones evolved as an effort for Glamour to continue to appeal to readers." -- abstract.

Wirsing explores a prairie lifestyle in transition--including population crises for rural communities, local school closings, deeply conservative ideologies, the mechanization of agriculture, and the ascension of pheasant hunting--before culminating with a divisive court case within his family over hunting rights, and even a jury trial over a 19-year-old mooning his own aunt. Wirsing has considerable political and philosophical misgivings about rural South Dakota, but he also maintains a great love for the prairie--its history, its landscape, its wildlife, and the people who give it its personality." -- abstract.

		"Sometimes words cannot express the emptiness you feel when you have lost or let go of someone important to you. This memoir vividly describes three losses that occured within one year: the breakup of a four-year relationship, the death of a friend, and the death of a family member. In the aftermath of these events, the author discovers she must resolve what has passed before she can move forward. Perhaps the saying that the closing of one chapter is the opening of a new one is the case when reading a book, but it is not always the case in life. These losses lead to some powerful discoveries and experiences and, in some instances, even more tragic realizations and relationships." -- abstract.

The work as a whole comprises a journey through figurative and literal versions of hell, in which characters such as Ajax and Odysseus appear alongside the quasi-mythological figure of the author's father." -- abstract.

		"The purpose of this study was to investigate how businesses in the health and pharmaceutical industries define and use communication strategies to manage intercultural issues in global organizational contexts. Literary research guided the study and a questionnaire explored behaviors that were translated into five categories: preparation for change, information exchange between the organization and the internal public, leadership, cultural awareness, and communication processes. Twelve organizations were invited to participate. Six replied to the questionnaire, three of them with more than one respondent. This enabled comparisons between the views of professionals in the headquarters and in foreign locations. Results suggested that organizations tend to overlook the importance of people and cultures. Differences cause issues that prevent effective intercultural communication to occur. To confirm the inferences made throughout the study, expand the categories presented here, and provide a better understanding to the questions left unanswered, future and more complex investigations are necessary." -- abstract.

The chapters are built upon a central event, leading up to and following the breakup of Raph's parents. But for the most part, the novel examines the lives of both Raph and his younger brother, Juan, pairing their own lives with the examples of their parents. It is a story that is both violent and intimate, showing a series of connections that bind them all together. And while Raph tries to break away from the violent history of his parents, he succumbs again and again; poisoned by the relationships his family has created for him." -- abstract.

Although the absence of a reading culture is difficult to prove quantitatively, this author hypothesizes that most black South Africans do not read for pleasure. Reading for pleasure here is defined as reading novels, rather than reading an alternative medium (such as a newspaper) primarily to gain content or spiritual knowledge. This thesis questions whether specifically the publishing industry's production of predominately English-language literature has helped to maintain a lack of reading for pleasure among black South Africans." -- abstract.

I believed that if I truly opposed the death penalty I should know whom I was trying to save. I had been sexually abused, and to me these men were the worst of the worst -- the ultimate test of my commitment. Any One of Us is a memoir about the three months I spent defending them, working in a New Orleans law firm specializing in death row defense, set against the backdrop of my childhood with law as my family's religion. The memoir follows me into the mysteries of the death penalty world; into Lousiana's infamous prison, Angola; and into what became my obsession with one client, the facts of his case, and the choice made by the woman who helped save him." -- abstract.

Through a historical analysis of Pop-Politics in television from the 1990s to present day and a close analysis of two television shows, The Simpsons and True Blood, this thesis demonstrates how this unique genre operates within television to spur social and political change." -- abstract.

Among many other things, it was an invitation to appreciate the comedic value of our attempts at holiness--which to my mind ultimately make God holier--as well as to build an entertaining and safe environment in which to consider and discuss religion." -- abstract.

		"During the political and social turmoil of the 1980s in South Korea, social science publishing exploded, providing theoretical tools and perspectives of Korean society for social change. The publishers of the 1980s were expelled student activists. They witnessed the trampling of liberty, the disparity of the poor and the rich, and the struggle of workers. Seeing themselves as the conscience of society, and possessed of intellectual curiosity and competence, they used publishing as a unique tool to change the society for the better." -- abstract.

		"In 1966, the Manning family was turned upside down when their father, Skip, was diagnosed with a locally malignant tumor in his lower spine. Skip survived almost nine years with the help of doctors, pain medication and alcohol. This won his wife and five children a substantial pension from Westinghouse, but that was the last thing on their minds. There was a difference of nine years between Skip's oldest and youngest children. Everyone remembered him differently because they were all dealing with their own demons. There was child abuse, street fights, anorexia, bulimia, kleptomania, alcoholisim, drag racing -- they all knew, but nobody talked about it.  As Good of a Bad Thing is the true story of Skip's struggle to survive and his family's struggle to live normally despite all odds." -- abstract.

In order to afford makeovers to appear more like their Hollywood idols with bleached-blond hair and designer accessories, teen girls began participating in enjo-kosai (compensated dating), selling their time and bodies to older men for monetary value. With the economy in flux and parents focused more on working overtime rather than on their own children, the morals and values that should have been taught at home were instead learned in a dysfunctional way with girls finding their own self-worth and confidence from every hundred-dollar bill they received from an enjo-kosai encounter." -- abstract.

		"The Prostitutes Union of Massachusetts (PUMA) was part of a national movement for prostitutes' rights that rapidly grew in fervor and intensity, and, just as quickly, faded from American consciousness. Centered in Boston and active throughout New England from 1975 through 1984, PUMA staged public actions, organized fundraisers, built coalitions with other social justice organizations, and lobbied lawmakers in the name of prostitutes' rights. In 1984, the women of PUMA opened the Finex House, a shelter for battered prostitutes, which last year celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. The story of PUMA reveals the economic disparities, gender inequalities, and political struggles that defined the years of its activity, both regionally and nationally. This thesis, a character-driven partial history of PUMA, is intended for a general audience in order to capture the cultural and political moment that gave rise to PUMA, whose reverberations can be felt today." -- abstract.

The struggles characters face throughout this collection may result either in new discoveries of the self or an unresolved dilemma.

Extensive research into the psychological formation of families and gay communities has provided the foundation for the construction of a one-man theatre piece that addresses adolescence in and the formation of "gay family." The result is a show that weaves together popular media, academic research, and personal anecdotes to tell a story of coming out, finding family, and making connections in a community separated along age lines, even as it declares its own inclusiveness." -- abstract.

He rediscovers an old college friend and one-time lover, Brad Little, who works in Boston as a consultant for his father's hedge fund, Carraway's Capital Partners. Brad ascribes to an esoteric, intuitive perspective of market forces that borders on mysticism, which has led him to conclude that the system itself must be guided into its own collapse. Tim joins Carraway, seduced by the promise of wealth and accompanying freedom. Brad also intrigues Tim personally; he remains the aloof, introspective, attractive guy that infatuated a younger Tim in college. Tim wrestles with these feelings and the unearthed hurt of his father's death, both of which inhibit him from a new, higher promise of happiness. Brad becomes more distant, which prompts Tim to investigate and uncover Brad's darker intention to ruin Carraway." -- abstract.

In 1951, Salinger published The Catcher in the Rye, one of the most well-known, well-loved and controversial novels by any American author. Following its success, he retreated into exile, spending the remaining six decades of his life in extreme privacy in Cornish, New Hampshire. Salinger gave few interviews in his entire life, and, though he continued to write, did not publish after 1965. He has remained an enigma for generations of readers, in America and around the world. This collection is an attempt to explore--through historical fact, personal reflection, and some speculation--the compelling aspects of Salinger's contributions as a writer and cultural influence." -- abstract.

		"Bowerbird is a video game in which the player takes on the role of male bowerbird, whose goal is to attract mates by building the best bower he can manage in the time allotted. Once the player finishes or quits, the game becomes unplayable for a full year. This forces the player to take the job seriously, carefully weighing time remaining against difficulty level--which can be switched at the expense of most of his or her progress at any time. The game is based on a crisis its designer sometimes faces when working on a creative project: keep working on something that is not going well and risk not finishing or turning in something that is not up to standard; or give up and start over. Several game mechanics contribute to the metaphor, attempting to evoke in the player the same feelings one goes through when faced with such a decision." -- abstract.

Growing up in Providence, Rhode Island the game had been his only tangible vision for the future, while also serving as a passport to a world beyond his blue-collar background. In his search to replace the excitement and sense of self basketball once provided, he wades through poignant moments and delicate relationships with family, friends, and fellow basketball junkies. The narrative leads to self-discoveries, shedding light on the effect sports can have on the coming-of-age process and life beyond the last game." -- abstract.

Already exhibiting an enormous impact on the cinematic landscape as we know it--its success prompting producers to promise "darker" interpretations of famous comic book heroes--the very fact that a mainstream superhero film can proffer such hefty ideas and succeed beyond already-high expectations makes it an unavoidably important part of the modern cinematic landscape." -- abstract.

Viewing the case in the context of the theories of commercialization and commodification, it is shown that the newspaper's coverage was a reflection of both its financial interests (to build circulation and advertising) and journalists' zeal for reform (using news to affect real change). Capitalistic for-profit orientation enabled the Post-Dispatch to expose officials' wrongdoing, but hindered other local newspapers, which were essentially muzzled by owners and advertisers." -- abstract.

The other half follows Valery - one of the many listeners who become obsessed by the power of the siren lurking within Alevtina's voice - as he strives to find some meaning for his warring emotions for Alevtina, to discover the cause of the many deths that occur during each of Alevtina's performances, and ultimately to try and save Alevtina from the enemy hiding within her. As a whole, Belladonna endeavors to put a new twist on classic mythology and bring new life to melodrama." -- abstract.

		"Dreamer's Requiem is a narrative poem in five sections narrated by a teenage female who lives in a city called Suburbia. After recounting what led her to join an underground rebel group called The Red Hand, she describes what happens when The Red Hand launches a violent uprising against Suburbia's reactionary Mayor and his new laws concerning the future of the city's health care. Finally, Suburbia, having been destroyed, the narrator decides to leave and search for a new beginning. Dreamer's Requiem ranges in form from rhymed quatrains to free verse paragraphs. Its dystopian atmosphere reflects various influences, among them: the 2010 Massachusetts Senate Race, the screenplay of the film 2012, and the music of the rock group Green Day." -- abstract.

		"As the latest research suggests, 30% of students are either bullies or victims, and though many adults still see bullying as 'just part of being a kid,' bullying can lead to many negative effects for victims, including suicide. Anti-bullying legislation has been passed in 45 states in the U.S., and schools are being held accountable for bullying incidents occuring among students. Laws call for educating teachers and students about the effects of bullying, how to prevent it, and how to deal with it when it happens. In order to educate effectively, many schools bring in outside sources. One example of this is the professional performance troupe, TIGER, out of Plymouth State University. This paper will explore the current trends in 'bullying,' history of the TIGER organization, my experiences performing with this group, the show's age appropriateness, and my experiences in the classroom when executing workshops." -- abstract.

Any stories, articles, pictures or diagrams that mention menstruation or related issues, such as the Pill or tampons, will be gathered from a two-year period, January 2009 to December 2010, and examined for wording, usage and meaning to determine how menstruation is constructed." -- abstract.

To accomplish this task, I have used my sexual encounters as a rabbit hole leading into and out of the Wonderland of my highschool and early collegiate educational experiences, including discussions of periods of human life I have not often seen in print, such as learning to masturbate. I believe that the text gives insight into what it means to be a young white middleclass male in contemporary American society, which is important because modern media has aggresively reduced this type to caricatures. I have also tried to shed light on the process of becoming." -- abstract.

Carr presents her heroines as goddess archetypes unwilling to yield their sovereign power, yielding instead to the expectations imposed upon them by role models and communities. In By the Bog of Cats...and The Mai, the central characters, Hester and The Mai, are consumed by the wasting sickness of unrequited love when their romances fail, a common theme in Irish mythology, and elect to end their lives rather than live with the pain and challenge of moving forward alone. White and black swans also figure heavily in both plays, as the traditional harbingers of death and couriers of souls, along with the themes of many other Irish and Greek myths. The tragedy of each of the heroines is made manifest by their immense potential for independent success juxtaposed against their mythic failures." -- abstract.

The linguistic features of AAE often resemble what are considered to be language disorders in Mainstream American English (MAE). Therefore, a clinician's knowledge and skills regarding the linguistic features of AAE is directly related to his/her ability to perform culturally and linguistically sensitive assessments and provide treatment to children from multicultural backgrounds. The goals of this project are to explore the clinical knowledge and experience of school-based SLPs, as measured by self-evaluation, of their abilities to (1) distinguish language difference [AAE] from a disorder, (2) identify a language difference [AAE] with a co-occurring disorder, as well as (3) administer culturally  and linguistically sensitive assessments and intervention to speakers of AAE who also have a language disorder." -- abstract.

		"The Internet has set changes in motion that will overturn every aspect of society--just as the printing press did a few centuries ago. Because the Internet changes the way people access and share information about society, the next logical conclusion is that society and society's government will change too. In a self-governing democracy, the attitude of citizens determine the viability toward democracy. This paper will explore the attitudes of college students toward citizenship, civic engagement, and online political participation. The ages and socio-economic status of the students place them in the generation that has never known life disconnected from the Internet. Online social networking was simultaneous with development of their social behavior. While many studies have explored different levels of online engagement, none has questioned how the self-identity of citizens encourages or discourages civic engagement." -- abstract.

		"Secular music styles, once condemned as corrupting influences on the moral fabric of the nation, have been appropriated and repackaged to promote Christian values and beliefs in the Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) industry. This study investigates the causes and consequences of this cultural phenomenon. Five long interviews were conducted with Christian musicians and analyzed in the context of existing research on the CCM industry, religion, and the media. Issues of artistic integrity, cultural identity, religious commodification and product-mediated spirituality are investigated through the prism of popular music." -- abstract.

A family council consists solely of family members and is the organizational and strategic planning arm of the family, which communicates and decides upon values, policy, and direction for the future; matters that influence both the family and the business are discusses in family council meetings (Jaffe, 1991). The current study took an exploratory analysis at family councils, seeking to identify communication behaviors that are reported by such councils.Two family members from six different councils participated, making a total of twelve participants. Faimly council participants completed a questionnaire or were interviewed." -- abstract.

But his rabbi has another plan--for Slocum to infiltrate the German-American Bund and spy on New York's homegrown Nazis. Working undercover, he soon finds himself compromised by his association with the Bund, both morally and criminally. Compelled to weigh his conscience against his intentions, Slocum must determine exactly where his sympathies lie, and how much he's willing to sacrifice." -- abstract.

		"In 2008, Braddock, Pennsylvania began receiving a wave of national media attention (The New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Atlantic, etc.). The attention largely centered around one man, Braddock's larger-than-life mayor, John Fetterman. At 6'8", 350 pounds, the mayor was lauded for attracting a group of twenty- and thirty-somethings--artists, misfits, wanderers--to this struggling rustbelt community. The press hailed their arrival as proof of a movement. Longtime residents weren't so sure. My project, which exists here in an early and experimental stage, looks at the disparity between this idyllic representation of Braddock-on-the-mend and the complexities of daily life in an unceasingly difficult place--a place rife with internal dispute, racial and regional tensions, and longstanding mistrust between locals and newbies. In the broadest sense, my project is the story of an American town struggling to reinvent itself after decades of hardship." -- abstract.

By scrutinizing the id, ego, and superego relationship in selected characters, along with their gendered behavior, narcissism, masochism, sublimating tendencies, and gendermandering, the result is a greater understanding of the cultural, social and political attitudes of the times. Focusing on female characters, this paper seeks to address the complex and evolving cultural attitudes toward women as they are represented in William Inge's work." -- abstract.

Each of these characters is struggling to belong in the hetero-normative society they each call 'home.' A gay couple's fear of raising children turns into a fear of taking responsibility; a single woman's fear of needing another person turns into a fear of the future with her son. Throughout the course of the play, the characters' conflicts escalate and, as is often the case, affect and hurt those they most love. This play attempts to maintain sensitivity for the characters, while presenting human insecurities in an uncensored way." -- abstract.

With each new focus comes a new tone, whether it is light and funny, quiet and thoughtful, or eerie and disturbing. Although their topics are vastly different, these stories are ultimately bound together by their common themes of loss and distance. As these themes emerge, they highlight details of the different family dynamics portrayed in these stories. The complexities of these relationships are never the same, but the undertones that arise show how powerful the need for human contact can be." -- abstract.

While never wanting for material possessions, they've grown up under the pressure of expectation and the belief that nothing bad can truly happen to them. When the outside world cracks the exterior of their sheltered lives, some crumble and some seek escape. Others see their problems slide off them like Teflon only to be left still wanting more from a life that has already provided them every advantage.

He kept up his ruse for two years--until he attended, in cap and gown, Penn's 2002 commencement ceremonies, with his family in attendance.

The stories question what it means to live in a society that pushes people to the margins and focus on the characters' coming to terms with being hybridized. The first five stories are linked by character, while the other eleven, which range in setting from 1918 to the present day and from Ireland to Boston, are linked by the theme of marginalization." -- abstract.

		"Before gaining worldwide fame as a 1930s film star, Mae West was a notorious New York City playwright, actress, and master of sensationalism. West possessed not only awareness of her own strengths as a performer--namely her sexuality--but also demonstrated a keen eye for the perception of cultural trends throughout the 1920s, actively working various taboo subject matters into her plays in order to garner controversy and attention. By positioning social taboos at the heart of her early work as a playwright--including the controversial topics of sex, drag, and jazz--Mae West entered into a provocative discourse with the sexual norms of her time and, in the process, carved out a discursive and performative space for a newly empowered female sexuality." -- abstract.

The media sends the message to girls that they are strong and have the power to make choices about who they are and who they want to become. They call it girl power. A decade ago, as the phrase girl power entered the mainstream, it became associated with female pop stars, female action heroes, and wealthy, sexualized celebrities. Today it is used to market toys, music, television, and music to girls. This film explores the influence of media in the lives of young women and questions whether the concept of "girl power" is an effective media campaign to empower them." -- abstract.

The poems playfully experiment with point-of-view and narrative distance, and the balance of free verse with more traditional forms (sestinas, villanelles, pantoums, sonnets, ghazals) is meant to suggest that poetic self-consciousness, or artifice, need not alienate readers or hinder storytelling. Thematically, the collection is (loosely) concerned with cycles of damage and healing - how we nagivate our pasts and our families, recover when relationships collapse, regenerate and reinvent ourselves - and the roles that art and humor play in those processes." -- abstract.

		Thesis (M.F.A.) -- Emerson College, 2010.
		"This is a collection of thirty-nine poems. Some of them work within forms and others depart from the conventions of formal poetry. Many of them approach the task of place making, and they do so in a way that acknowledges both connection and disconnection in the world. Many of the poems in this collection also address the relationship between emotional and physical landscapes. Although there are several poems that involve relationships between people, these relationships are often illustrated more clearly through the physical details of the landscapes within them. There are also quite a few poems that blur the boundaries between popular culture and academic, or literary culture. These poems work within ekphrastic, narrative, lyrical, formal, and experimental modes." -- abstract.

		"Packing with Proust is a travel memoir about my pilgrimage to literary sites around the world. I wander through the houses and graveyards of dead authors and fictional characters, searching in abandoned landscapes for a story I can call my own. I baptize myself in Walden Pond, survive a Bloomsday celebration in Dublin, and recover a lost childhood in Proust's Illiers-Combray. These places of literature become, like Proust's madeleine, catalysts that trigger memories in which I read the unfolding of my own story." -- abstract.

While violence and deception occur thematically, the poems resist moralizing in an attempt to show how love and devotation are often severe. The title, the Obedient Ear, comes from two sources: Proverbs 25:12 and the Analects of Confucius. But the title also evokes the difficulty of being a young poet listening in two directions at once: to the poetic tradition and to the individual voice developing within." -- abstract.

In particular, women raised in the south are often faced with unrealistic expectations and stereotypes, especially if they become pregnant outside of the constitution of marriage. Instead they are expected to remain pure and chaste until marriage and follow all principles spelled out by the Bible. So what happens when a women (sic) raised in the Bible Belt finds herself pregnant before she walks down an aisle?" -- abstract.

		Explores the cultural, ethical, and philosophical implications of training sport horses for competition from both a personal and critical perspective. Follows the author as she learns that behavior she'd interpreted as misbehavior and naughtiness was the horse's attempt to communicate severe pain.  As the author struggles with the idea that the things we love are inevitably hurt by the way we love them, she insists that good intentions cannot change or alleviate the burden of mistakes.

Notes:		Documentary film about the culture of gift giving as an economic practice in a rural Italian town.  Focuses primarily on Dr. Paolo Cherubino, an orthopedic surgeon living in a rural Tuscan village, who treats local villagers free of charge based on their needs.  Having no ability to compensate him for his services, the local people bring various gifts in exchange for their treatment. This has the effect of making Dr. Cherubino an unofficial lord of a small fiefdom: he takes care of his subjects and they in turn look after his interests.  The film investigates the resurgence of medieval lord-and-subject gift economy that appears to be occuring in this region.

At the end of the project I video document myself removing socially wanted hair, head hair and eyebrows to create an extreme counter argument against the living experience of the norm. It is a project of deconstructing and then rebuilding an ideal femininity that differs from what the mass media has planted inside me. The process serves as a personal mind evolution as well as an examination of the hairlessness norm that is strictly applied on women."--Abstract.

		"Following the Orange [R]evolution in 2004, popular protests of Ukrainian citizens in 2013-2014 ... altered the poltical regime in the country. In the battle against the corrupt government, protesters have demonstrated a sophisticated use of the Internet and social media tools in news dissemination and mobilization of activism. This study investigates another dimension of the protests -- the media effects of social media on news organizations within the framework of agenda setting theory."--Abstract.

		"What is more important: being good or trying to be? The characters in these 10 stories struggle with that question one way or another as the systems they either willingly choose or are forced into push down on them even further. Family, religion and community can all empower people to rise above their current standings, but these stories explore what happens when the dynamic moves in the other direction. At what point does individual desire trump safety and surety?" --Abstract.

The  residents feel forgotten by the world. The need to reach out and be heard is explored in every story, from the young woman who starts to have phone conversations with her husbandâs gay lover, to the dyslexic man who confronts his cruel teacher years later." -- Abstract.

Notes:		"Crown of Gamma is a feature-length, narrative film. Composed in five chapters, and designed for consumption via a VHS box set with five modules, the film invites narrative scrambling and corporeal dismemberment (atomistic separation of form) from the viewer. The film deals with the transmutation to shamanism, refraction of soul into eternal, and the understanding of fifth dimensional empathy -- the first chapter reflecting the fifth chapter, the second chapter reflecting the fourth chapter, and third chapter acting as keystone. The film's structure is a manifestation of formalist recursion -- toward the destination of transfiguration."--Abstract.

		"The poems of Here move through experiences of pain inflicted on and by oneself -- physical brutality, sexual transgression and shame, domestic violence -- and ultimately ask what can be gained from our attention to such wounding. In pieces couched alternately in the duress and strange beauty of language, Here examines the possibilities for compassion, renewal, and forgiveness by leaning into places of discomfort." --Abstract.

		Title on title page and spine reads: "The seperation of Terry Buehler."
		"Terry Buehler, adrift in life since the sudden death of his mother, wakes one morning to find he has been separated from reality. That is meant literally and the mechanics are explained herein, but the reader is free to draw their own conclusions regarding metaphorical resonance. A mixture of surreal horror and character driven reflection on the things Terry has lost, Terry's adventure forces him to reforge the human bonds that once tied him to the world. Madness and nightmares stand in his way, but the angels of his past life might just be able to save him from himself. This thesis represents about two-thirds of a full-length novel." --Abstract.

Covering the first two sections of the journey across the state, from Buffalo to Rochester, this travel narrative includes moments with sport fanatic friends, tall-tale telling family members, and his skeptical Russian girlfriend. [The author's] journey takes him through the surprising hidden history of the region and explores how it not only helped to create both the Empire State and the American Empire, but also how not to prepare for a long bike trip and why more people than you'd expect throw animals off waterfalls." --Abstract.

Former strangers, they have bonded together against the threat of those who would harm them for the food in their packs or the shoes on their feet. They travel away from the city, instinctively seeking isolation in the hope that wilderness will save them from humanity. But Sidney carries a secret - a pregnancy from a previous relationship, putting their very survival at risk. Sidney must decide if she can trust Aster with her secret, and they both must decide if it's worth living, just to survive." -- Abstract.

		"This collection intends to support the notion that the power of writing can revise a history unfathomed. While we may or may not recall an incident or an experience as true, we have the power to adjust memory to engage interpretation, and therefore continually rewrite our pasts to better effect a constantly shifting present. These poems address and grapple with that concern." --Abstract.

The film is constantly moving between the body of the drawn figure, the body of the paper and the tracings of my own body." --Abstract.

The stories are tied thematically in their dealings with issues of (dis)placement, the human need to beat on through hopelessness, and the ways in which we cope with desperation through  eccentric acts of defiance and surrender." --Abstract.

Using music and humor as primary affective hooks, this project sought to raise awareness of the need for civics education in Greater Boston, and, in doing so, increase demand for its provision. More specifically, this experiment sought to test whether emotionally resonant mechanisms, in the absence of didactics, could catalyze shifts how people construct their 'knowledge area hierarchies,' or rankings of academic topics and life skills that people believe important for their children to possess." --Abstract.

		"The film is meant to vaguely mimic television narrative structure as a pilot for a potential web series. The plot follows awkward, fish-out-of-water protagonist Roger the Robot. One year after Roger's mad-scientist creator, robot fianceÌ and "best frenemy" all die at once in a fiery explosion, the lonely robot must face reality that he is a male stripper living out of a cardboard box behind the library he frequents and not an aspiring ballerino-in-training. Following a librarian's offer of a place to stay as a roommate, Roger unexpectedly gets his "package" stolen by Emma, a femme fatale being coerced into espionage by the Russians." --Abstract.

		"Where Does She Go is an experimental video that investigates how we distinguish reality from fantasy.  Employing a high definition digital camera and casting a nonhuman object as the subject, Where Does She Go documents a mannequin touring across the world.  By examining ways and angles of seeing, while also scrutinizing the cognitive structure of hearing, the video attempts to question the authenticity of visual discerning." --Abstract.

More, though, they are intended to expose areas of the human condition that transcend the regional and demographic characteristics in which the stories are seated. The people here and their storiesâtheir fears, their hopes, their hardshipsâare those that all people face.  And so one small corner of the world, Harmony, Maine, becomes a window into the lives of regular folks everywhere." --Abstract.

		"Explores the perception of a particular brown body, in this case a brown boyâs body. The title poem was inspired by Wallace Stevensâ 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,' but after some great advice, I realized that it was also the title of this short collection, as it navigates the process of understanding that there are various ways one can become aware of oneâs own body through the awareness of others, which is why the first four sections focus on 'looking' at others until the final section, where the gaze is turned onto the particular suggested brown body in the title. Ultimately, this collection tries to answer the question of what it means to really know something. But it doesnât give an answer, it's only anexercise." --Abstract.

Fabulist elements call attention to this process of evaluation, collapsing the distance between what is internal and what is external." --Abstract.

Ostracized by her society for her abilities and her gender, she nevertheless receives an invitation from the Emperor himself to construct his dream project: a new city in his name that will represent that could make her name.  But this grand project comes at a dangerous time.  An infectious madness sweeps across the red plains of the nation, driving the afflicted to bloodlust and twisted prophecy.  A war with the Westerners starves the populace to desperate measures and threatens to derail everything.  And Elizabethâs own secret relationship with Catherine may yet spell not only her doom but the doom of everything sheâs ever loved.  Can she successfully navigate this new world?  And at what cost?" --Abstract.

		"'Say It Wonât Be Lonely' offers insight into the life of a gay man whose transformation from nearly celibate to comically oversexed is both clumsy and unexpected.  Told in the voice of a pop-culture-obsessed millennial with a staggeringly weak sense of self-awareness, the book uses humor to contrast the intimacy in platonic relationships with the absence of intimacy in casual sex. In addition, the book confronts themes of questioning the valorization of masculinity, the importance of friendship versus romantic love, and changing perspectives of self-worth in the LGBTQ community." --Abstract.

		"A collection of nonfiction humor essays about life in my twenties as a Midwest girl living on the East Coast, sometimes questioning and other times declaring my position in the world.  My essays find me crawling through puffin shit to the edge of an Icelandic cliff as I try to understand the urban millennial's obsession with houseplants and contemplating what it means to be a person who instinctively throws her arm into closing subway doors.  No matter the setting, my writing maintains a distintive and disarming voice as I detail how I've made sense of and learned from the people and places around me." --Abstract.

		"This collection of essays charts the emergence of a searching social consciousness throughout a young womanâs early adulthood. Interweaving the genres of memoir, criticism, and narrative journalism, these seven pieces explore the ad hoc nature of a moral educationâfrom formative encounters with art and literature, to experiences that bring new light to the old maxim, the personal is political. These essays range broadly, taking up feminism's conflicted lessons on the subject of loneliness; the meaning of selflessness, understood through the history of bridal gifts; and the legacy of utopian literature in the era of #MeToo. Together, they trace a feminist awakening that is also a personal process of becomingâof choosing among many possible selves and lives, setting oneâs sights for an as-yet unimaginable future." --Abstract.

The man, forty-five-year old Gregory Mercer, who took sexual advantage of her ten years ago, when she was fourteen, has just been arrested for similar crimes.  Amy has never told a soul about this affair, and she contemplates if she ever will.  Gradually, her secrets begin to weigh on her and distract her from the many facets of her life: her boyfriend Caleb, her graduate program, her father's cancer recurrence, and her family relationships.  Amy is paralyzed by what happened between her and her teacher, haunted by the music that she no longer listens to, and the violin, hidden away in her childhood closet, that she no longer plays." --Abstract.

The constant questions put to her, 'What kind of girl behaves this way?' and 'What kind of girl are you?' become obstacles that fracture and reconstruct her identity, increasing her insecurity about gender, race, class, language and sexuality. Through childhood and adolescence, her struggle to both fit in and stand out as a strong and talented Malawian girl leads her, first, to self-destructive behavior and ever escalating risks. Alienated from the standards and expectations of those who raise and educate her, she lives in an imaginative world of music, drama and American television which help her start a journey to live on her own terms." --Abstract.

There were an estimated seventy-five to 100 LGBTQ+ bookstores in the United States at their peak in the 1990s, but there remain only six today.  These bookstores have closed largely due to financial struggles, caused by high rent prices, the most recent economic recession, and competition from Amazon.  However, LGBTQ+ bookstores are still as important as ever in terms of representation, promotion of LGBTQ+ authors and content, and a sense of belonging for the community as a whole.  This thesis explores the history of LGBTQ+ bookstores, their impact on the community, sustainable business models, and their continued relevance in 2018." --Abstract.

With no inherent aptitude, Emily is barred from learning magic, but finds instruction with a group of magical rejects.  They band together against the sinister Dean of Students, who masterminds a plan to gain exclusive control of the worldâs magic.  Along the way the group forms bonds of friendship, family, and love; become powerful magicians; and develop an epic final project that changes the face of magicâand the worldâforever." --Abstract.

		"Speech sound disorders (SSDs) comprise a large percentage of school-based speech-language pathologistsâ (SLPs) caseloads.  Many service delivery models have been proposed to manage rising caseload sizes. One particular approach, Response to Intervention (RTI), was introduced in the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  This model ensures that children who do not require special education services still receive individualized support.  Given the risk for literacy impairments in children with SSDs, it is imperative to explore how RTI is implemented for this population of children.  In this study, we asked 575 school-based SLPs if they implement RTI for children with SSDs.  Further, we explored which practice characteristics and geographical factors may be associated with the use of RTI for children with SSDs. Results revealed that SLPs with smaller caseloads are more likely to implement RTI for children with speech sound disorders. Clinical and legislative implications are discussed." --Abstract.

		"Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prefer communicating via computers, rather than face-to-face. We analyzed how four adolescents with ASD used social language in a face-to-face conversation, followed by two conversations with the same partner represented as a computer avatar.  Specifically, we investigated the use of contingent language in response to close-ended questions and to bait-and-hook statements.  Bait-and-hook statements created a natural opening in conversation for the participant to initiate a contingent question to advance the conversation.  Results showed that participants used consistent words across face-to-face and the second computer condition.  Most notably, participants asked more contingent questions in responseto bait-and-hooks when communicating with the avatar.  This suggests that avatars may facilitate verbal interactions in ASD, creating an opportunity for individuals to use advanced social language, such as contingent questions in an implicit âopeningâ to progress a conversation." --Abstract.

Children with ASD were found to lag behind TD peers in both frequency and proportion of questions asked.  Children with ASD were reported to ask more closed-ended (yes/no) questions as compared to more open-ended wh-questions.  In exploring question function, differences between diagnostic groups became more profound as language level increased.  However, survey responses about echolalia suggest that questions asked by children with ASD are, indeed, generative." --Abstract.

		"Children with autism spectrum disorder often use unconventional language (e.g., echolalia, stereotyped speech). However, based on the existing literature, it remains unclear whether unconventional language is best understood as a marker of developmental achievement or a problematic behavior.  The present investigation is comprised of three smaller studies, each using an existing longitudinal dataset.  Study 1 revealed that young children with high levels of clinician-observed unconventional language had higher social communication skills.  However, Study 2 highlighted a number of discrepancies between parent- and clinician-reported unconventional language and measures of language, cognition, adaptive functioning, and repetitive behaviors.  Study 3 indicated that higher levels of parent-reported stereotyped language predicted lower adaptive skills in early adulthood, while higher levels of parent-reported neologisms and idiosyncratic language predicted higher functional language skills.  This work has important implications for the measurement and conceptualization of unconventional language." --Abstract.

Seventy-four caregivers of children with ASD (aged 2;2-5;11) participated in an online caregiver survey to measure overheard speech and pronoun mastery.  Results suggested higher access to overheard speech was associated with greater mastery of the pronouns me, my, you,and your.  Logistic regressions confirmed the role of overheard speech for the pronouns me, my, and you.  These findings suggest that children with ASD may benefit from overheard speech during pronoun development similarly to TD (typically developing) peers." --Abstract.

		"Shared book reading (SBR) is associated with many aspects of language growth for children who are deaf and hard of hearing.  Parents of children with hearing loss often report difficulty engaging their children in successful reading experiences.  The goal of this research was to examine the extent to which a 4-week SBR training influences caregiver knowledge of important early literacy concepts and results in increased confidence levels. Three caregivers with deaf or hard of hearing infants and toddlers attended a 4-week SBR training. Pre- and post-test questionnaires were used to assess caregiversâ knowledge of SBR and early literacy.  An additional follow-up questionnaire was completed to rate self-percieved changes in confidence levels.  This study contributes to the field by determining that knowledge gains and increased confidence can result from a brief caregiver training, as well as providing suggestive feedback for future trainings of this nature." --Abstract.

Lisette is a recently divorced mother of a new baby and 8-year-old son.  In need of income and struggling to re-enter the work force, she discovers an untapped market of bodybuilders, eager to buy breast milk as a supplement.  Maybe Later is a pilot that sets the background for a half-hour network comedy that asks the question 'When is it time to give up on your dreams?' It explores the tension between career and family for women in their late thirties.  The body of work reflects themes around motherhood, aging, and the unique pressures women face in the pursuit of success." --Abstract.

Mickey's morning begins by facilitating aggressive, intense sexual intercourse with her pseudo-partner and long-time friend, Adam. Mickey races over to work a closing shift at the bar. It is unusually quiet even for a sleepy, winter Sunday. Mickey soon meets the intriguing yet questionable Tennessee Baker, a customer she has never seen before. As the day passes and the more interactions they have together, Mickey grows increasingly unnerved by him. A series of harrowing events occurring while they are alone in the bar cause Mickey to face her own sense of power, what it means to have agency, and what constitutes as a violation." --Abstract.
